This is my assignment, called O'neillo board game.
https://github.com/Mominah-A/OthelloG.git

This is a windows form application that follows the rules and game logic of the othello board game. In this, two players are required to play against eachother, and also have the opportunity to save, exit and start a new game. The classes within the project show how the GUI has been designed and how the game logic has been structured.
